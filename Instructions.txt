To install: Extract the SaccFlightAndVehicles folder into your Assets folder
To update: Use your folder browser to delete your old SaccFlightAndVehicles folder, and replace it with the new one. Don't do it inside Unity.

Migrating a 1.8.0 project to 1.8.1 info:
I adjusted the grip curves on all vehicle wheels to mitigate a weird issue when in high gear on a low-hz monitor, issue can still occur at 60hz/a high enough gear.

Migrating a 1.7 project to 1.8.0 info:
Saccflight is now using Semantic Versioning. 1.71 would be 1.7.1 in the new scheme.
REMEMBER: IF IN DOUBT, CHECK AN EXISTING PREFAB'S VALUES
The custom weapon damage system has changed to use VRChat's new NetworkEventWithParameters functionality.
	Particle weapons(bullets) can now do any amount of damage. See the 'Particle damage system' section for details
	Damage particles are no longer used by explosives in the base prefab, a new damage system has been added to do damage based on distance to target.
		An expanding shockwave setting has also been added to explosive weapons, doing damage only after the shockwave hits the target (optional).
		It is still possible to use damage particles if you wish, but the prefab setup and animations for it have been removed.
The BulletDamageTaken variable has been removed completely and replaced with ArmorStrength on the SaccEntity script. see the 'Armor system' section below.
Worlds with races: The RaceTimeReporter script has been removed and the race time reporting has been simplified and moved into the race script (using NetworkEventWithParameters). Delete the object/s
Cars:
SGV_Effects now has a seat movement system that moves the seat based on G forces, set the 'Driver Seat Movement' transform variable to use it.
all vehicle wheels have a new grip curve, this grip curve works a lot better, so open the 'Grip Curve' graph on the wheels of one of the car prefabs, save it as a preset on the graph editor, and apply it to your vehicles if you wish. Do the same for 'Grip Curve Lateral'
Tanks:
Custom armor values are now be set up by naming your empty 'a:2' instead of 'armor:2' so just search&replace. This is to match the naming scheme of the weapon damage system and make it easier to expand.

The SaccFlightMenu.cs editor script sets up some things automatically when entering play mode, or building the scene. Things like the WindController no longer need you to manually assign all vehicles to them, it's done automatically.
I have done this with everything that requires simple lists to be filled out, or if there's only one of something in a scene that should be always be used. Things should be a little less fiddly to set up now. I plan to add more editor script stuff in future.
If you wish to run the code that does that stuff while in the editor, the option SaccFlight->Debug_OnBuild_SetReferences runs the function.
If you haven't set up a reference camera in your VRCWorld when you try to build the scene, It will be done automatically, matching how it's set up in Test Pilots.
Giving a Vehicle/Target/SaccEntity the EditorOnly tag will cause the SetReferences function to add references which will become null references and cause scripts to crash, so don't do that.

Explanation of some scripts:
SaccEntity:
Main object script, sends events, has rigidbody on it.
SaccAirVehicle/SaccSeaVehicle/SaccGroundVehicle:
Main vehicle control scripts
SAV_EffectsController/SAV_SoundController:
Visual effects and audio effects for SaccAirVehicle
SGV_EffectsController:
Both visual effects and audio effects for SaccGroundVehicle
SaccWheel:
Wheel physics AND effects+sounds for the wheel
WaterTrigger:
Tells the vehicle when it enters and leaves water
SyncScript:
The custom position sync script
KillTracker:
Not required, used to make the KillsBoard work. Can be used without the killboard if you want to use the events that it sends for something else.
DFUNC_*
Function dial scripts
EXT_*
non-type specific extensions (turrets..)

Function Dials:
SaccEntity has 2 arrays, one for left dial functions, and right dial functions.
Any number of functions can be placed in each array. The code divides the dial up automatically for selection. (Not visually, just for control input, you must make the visuals yourself)
The order they are input into that array is the order they'll work on the dial, clockwise. (First function is in straight up, unless the 'Left/RightDialDivideStraightUp' is ticked, in which case it's to the right of straight up. The ST-Baron's function dial uses this, if you need an example, the StickDisplay mesh is rotated negatively by half of a function)
The visuals of the function dial must be set up to match the function dial arrays.
	As of version 1.7 there is a new menu item that will create a the function dial visuals automatically, matching the set up in SaccEntity (or SAV_PassengerFunctionsController)
		To use it, select the SaccEntity (or any child of it) and click on SaccFlight->Create Stick Displays (Selected) from the menu bar.
			It will create new dials at the position of the currently selected object in the hierarchy, however, you must still set up all of the references to the dials (like the FuncOn(from the DFUNC scripts) objects and the L/RStickDisplayHighlighter(from SaccEntity)
The MFD.fbx file containts 12 divider meshes for function dials for dials with those number of functions. Named StickDisplay2-12 (the old default, 8, is just named 'StickDisplay')
Function dial scripts contain a 'funcon' (function on) reference if they are toggles. It's the object that appears to highlight the function on the dial when it's enabled.
To set the 'funcon' rotations, you can type '360/7' for example, into its Z rotation(if you have 7 functions). Then multiply the result by the dial position -1, then multiply by -1.

================================================================================================================

Inside the /Prefabs folder are individual prefabs for each vehicle, you can place them and they should work right away.
Open the example scene 'SaccFlightExample.unity' to see an example of vehicles set up to work with the Killsboard and racing scripts.

Race set up:
There's an object called RacingTrigger inside the InVehicleOnly/PilotOnly object, It should be disabled by default, it's enabled when a race is selected by the SaccRaceToggleButton script.
The SaccRaceToggleButton has a list of SaccRaceCourseAndScoreBoard objects and toggles through them when interacted with, enables the racingtrigger objects if a race is selected, and tells all racingtriggers to switch to the selected race.
The RaceToggleButton contains a hidden reference to every race, it's set up automatically on build.
Each race has a script called SaccRaceCourseAndScoreBoard. This contains references for its race's checkpoints, and has text objects for displaying the times.
The RacingTrigger detects checkpoints, tracks your time, and sends your time to the SaccRaceCourseAndScoreBoard script for the selected race when you finish.
Race checkpoints have an animation that enables guidance objects when the checkpoint is next or after next.
New in 1.63: Races have a full scoreboard showing everyones times. Times are reported by taking ownership of the SaccRaceTimeReporter object when you finish a race.
	A delayed check is run by the player reporting their time to make sure that their time was actually recieved (if for example two people tried to take ownership/report their times at the same time). Missed times are re-submitted.
The RaceToggleButton now has a checkbox for [x]Automatic Race Selection
With this enabled you no longer need to select races, they will automatically enable when you go near either the beginning, or end of a race. Loop race's direction is decided by the direction you go through the start line.

Killsboard set up:
Place the killboard anywhere in the world, each vehicle that uses it must have its own SAV_KillTracker, referenced in it's SaccEntity's Extension Udon Behaviours list.

Some of the animations use Unity's 'Motion Time' feature which makes the animation be controlled by a float parameter (which is controlled by effectscontroller).
float value 0(or less) = play the first frame of the animation
float value 1(or more) = play the last frame of the animation
and everything in between accordingly.

The MachVapor for example uses the mach10 variable. This variable = 1 at mach10, and 0 when not moving. The animation is 1000 frames long, and the MachVapor is enabled on frame 97 and disabled on frame 102, which corresponds to transitioning mach1.
This variable can be used to do other things like F-14 wings moving back at a certain speed.
The AoA variable is 0 at 0 angle of attack, and 1 at 180.
Cars have a variable called 'speed' that is 0-1 as 0-500 m/s.

Making your own vehicles:

Aircraft:
When making a new vehicle, place the prefab that is closest in type to your desired vehicle and Unpack Prefab. Now your objective is to replace the mesh object (PlaneBody on the SF-1) completely.
I recommend just disabling it at first(delete it once you're done using it as a reference), and placing your mesh next to it on the hierarchy. The first thing you should do is set the VehicleMesh to your new mesh in the SaccAirVehicle script.
Next add colliders to your mesh(or armature), any collider types are fine. If your vehicle has wheels, i recommend copying the wheel colliders from the SF-1, and adjusting the size to fit your wheels.
Now go through the entire hierarchy and move all the empties, effects, and sounds to the proper position for your new vehicle.
Finally, duplicate the Animatons folder for the vehicle prefab you used, move it, rename it, apply the animation controller within to your vehicle, and go through each layer and replace the animations with the new ones from the copied folder.
When you're done look at the EffectsController and SoundController, and make sure no array references are empty (the ones that you can change the length of), the script will crash if any are.

Tips for modifying basic flight characteristics of aircraft:
If it's having trouble taking off, try adjusting the center of mass and pitch moment positions, as well as the ground effect settings.
The Strength and Friction values for pitch, yaw, and roll are important, and both play off each other. You may need to set them to very high values, especially if you make a large plane.
Rot Multi Max Speed will need to be adjusted for planes with different speeds. It's the speed at which (in meters per second) the plane reaches maximum responsiveness.
Vel Straighten Str Pitch/Yaw are Very important to the handling of the plane. They push the nose toward the velocity direction. (they also interact with pitch and yaw strength)
Lift and Max Lift are also very important, and a bit tricky to tweak. If max lift is too high you can end up with a plane that can fly in circles extremely quickly. Reducing Max Lift will make the plane bleed much more speed in turns which is more realistic. Try around 3.
The Vel Lift/Max values are used to prevent the plane's nose from dropping constantly (counter gravity). Find a Vel Lift Max value that keeps the nose steady, Max is 10 by default but technically could be 9.81 to counter gravity exactly
Vel Lift value is used to decide how quickly the plane reaches Vel Lift Max.
Don't change the angular drag or drag of the rigidbody, they are both handled by the script.

Tips for VTOL Only aircraft:
For helicopters, keep the VTOL Thrust Vec values at 1, and adjust Pitch Yaw and Roll Strength
Pitch Down Lift Multi has a pretty big effect on how fast the vehicle can move forwards
The constant friction values are intended for helicopters (gyroscopic forces stop rotation)
You can make the blade tilt angle larger than implied in order to make the vehicle faster
Set Adverse yaw to 0 if you don't want the helicopter to spin when increasing the throttle
the Vel Straighten values are just as important for the handling of helicopters as planes

The hud can be made to appear smaller by moving all children of the 'bigstuff' object +Z local. 'bigstuff' is a child of HudController.
The one exception is hud_elevation, it's position must be 0,0,0 in order for it to move correctly, the only resizing you can do to it and have its functionality remain correct is on the X axis.

Visual animations are done by either EffectsController directly, HudController if they're local/only when you're in the plane, or through the animator (via values sent to it by EffectsController or modular functions).
Doing animations using the animator is most performant, so I've used it where possible. Some HUD stuff included.
When making a custom plane, you must customize a number of the animations, I recommend duplicating the SF-1's animation controller and animations, and modifying the animations that need changing.
Likely to need replacing animations:
AAMs
AGMs
Bombs
Brake
CanopyOpen
Explode
FlapsOn
Mach
GearUp
TailHook
TailHookHooked
ThrottleSlider
EngineOutput
EngineOutputAB
Pitch
Yaw
Roll
Remember for animations that are controlled by floats that use motion time, set the animation curves to linear.
Joystick animation is done in the Pitch Yaw and Roll animations. Each one rotates a seperate empty of which the joystick is the last child of.

Hierarchy:
PlaneBody--------
Everything in here is visual, except that it also contains colliders, and wheel colliders. Objects can be placed as children of this if they need to move with parts of it (SS-1)
SaccAirVehicle--------
Children of this are transforms used by the SaccAirVehicle
EffectsController--------
The children of this are mostly particle systems, visual effects used by EffectsController and the animator.
SoundController--------
The children are all the sounds the plane uses. The AttachedSounds object contains all sounds that are disabled instantly when the plane explodes. The 'beeps' empty contains all the cockpit beep sounds, just move the 'beeps' object instead of all children individually.
InVehicleOnly--------
The children of this are all things that are disabled when you're not inside the vehicle. Many different objects are in here including the HUD and menus.
HUDController's 'bigstuff' child object is scaled to 720 to make the hud appear to be on the sky like a real HUD(roughly 1km away). You may want to scale it down to 1 temporarily if you plan on editing HUD elements.
PilotSeat--------
PassengerSeat--------
Custom station with seat adjustment code for entering the plane
AAMs--------
AGMs--------
Bombs--------
These 3 objects just contain meshes to visually represent how many missiles etc you have left. Controlled by the animator.

Cars:
Place the car prefab that matches closest with the car you want to create. You need to replace the mesh, animations, update the references and move everything into position.
Break the prefab completely, and place your new vehicle's mesh above the current mesh object. Set the position and rotation of the new mesh to 0,0,0, set Y rotation to match the original vehicle if necessary.
Disable the original vehicle mesh for now, we will copy some stuff from it soon.
Add collder to your new mesh, and modify it to fit. Any number of colliders is fine, but you cannot use mesh colliders that are not set to Convex.
Set mesh's main object to the Walkthrough layer (17)
Set up the wheels, which require a specific rig setup to work (you may need to use Blender).
The hierarchy is as follows: The main wheel(SaccWheel)'s transform must be at the bottom of the tire, where it touches the ground, It should have a child that contains (or is painted to) the mesh of the wheel.
The SaccWheel's transform orientation should be as follows: With 'Pivot' and 'Local' transform view options, and the move tool selected, The blue arrow should point towards the front of the car, red to the right, and green up.
With this set up, the wheel's position you see in the editor will be the fully compressed suspension position. The ST-Baron is set up a bit weird because it was the first vehicle I created.
Copy the wheel script from the original car, and paste it on to each of your wheel's main transforms, (front and back wheel settings are usually a bit different, so you can copy the back to the back, and the front to the front)
Set each wheel's Wheel Point transform input to it's own gameobject, and Wheel Visual to the child object that contains the wheel mesh.
Move the gameobjects named SkidAudio_Tarmac, SkidAudio_Grass, SkidParticle_Tarmac, SkidParticle_Grass from the original mesh's wheels into each of your wheels, and make sure the references for them are set up in the new wheel's 'Surface Type_Skid Sounds', and the 'Surface Type_Skid Particles' arrays.
You can now delete the original mesh object.
In the SaccGroundVehicle Object, update the references for:
Vehicle Mesh -> The mesh object you replaced the original with
Main Object Renderer -> Place the largest Mesh renderer/SkinnedMeshRenderer on your new mesh in this slot
Drive Wheels -> Put all wheels that are used to accelerate the car in here. 
Steer Wheels -> Put all the wheels used for steering in here, for 4WD vehicles, put the front wheels in both arrays.
Other Wheels -> Put in any other wheels
The functions for brake and handbrake also need to reference the wheels that they used. Go to DialFunctions/L/DFUNC_Brake and DFUNC_HandBrake and fix the missing references in the 'Brake Wheels_Front' and 'Brake Wheels_Back' arrays.
In each Wheel script, set the wheel radius to match your car's wheels. You can experiment with suspension values too. I recommend doing so in play mode. Make sure you're sitting in the driver seat so that the physics doesn't fall asleep.
Move the CoM object to where the center of mass for your new vehicle should be.
	Unrealisticly fast cars need it to be very low down.
		Alternatively, the WheelForceApplyPoint transform of each wheel can be used. Set it to an empty transform with a higher position instead of lowering the CoM. This is usually a better option especially for arcade style cars.
If you test your vehicle now it should be able to drive forward, but the suspension may be strange, and it won't be able to steer.
Steering is done through an animation. Duplicate the original vehicle's Animations folder and move it into your own folder.
Rename the animation controller in that folder to the name of your vehicle, and apply it to your vehicle's animator (it's on the vehicle's main object, same object as the rigidbody).
Go through each layer of the animator and replace each of the animation node's animations with the ones from the copied folder.
Go through each of the animations and set them up with your new mesh. Refer to the original prefabs to see how they should be. The 'SteeringWheel' animation contains the movement of the steeringwheel and wheels.
Go through the whole hierarchy of the vehicle, and move everything to match the position of the new mesh. The eye position of seats is the 'TargetHeight' child object.
Car prefabs should put the vehicle in the air, above the point where the suspension visualization lines are touching the ground. If the wheels are touching the ground at spawn, a bug where the vehicle is flung into the air when entering a new world can occur.

Tips for adjusting car speed:
	Set the GearRatios[] in SGV_Gearbox to define the theoretical top speed. The Final Drive variable can be used to effectively multiply them all at once.
	Set SaccGroundVehicle's 'DriveSpeed' (how fast the engine speeds up)
	Set each of the DriveWheels 'EngineInfluence', this value behaves like adjusting engine torque, lower number=more torque.

Common problems with cars:
If the ExtraRayCastDistance is set too high, the ground detection ray can hit the top of the car causing the car to flip over endlessly.
Wheel suspension technically never actually bottoms out. If you want the suspension to bottom out at a certain point, it's probably best to just put a small sphere collider with no friction at the bottoming out point.

Info about surface types for SaccWheel scripts:
There's an array called 'Surface Type_Grips[]' with 10 entries. The object that the wheel is touching's name is checked,
and if it ends with a number, that number is read as surface type.
The grip of the wheel is multiplied by the corresponding element in this array, and the corresponding elements from the skid particles and sounds array are used for skids.
By default: 0 = Tarmac, 1 = Dirt/Grass, 2 = Ice. 3-9 are for you to define, but by default have same grip as tarmac. Any object without a number will be treated as tarmac.
There's a menu item at 'SaccFlight->Make All Static Colliders Tarmac...' that will rename all static colliders so that they are tarmac, you will then have to rename all dirt/other manually.

How to animate engine pitch:
In the 'Revs' animation, you will notice that the engine sound's audiosource's X Scale is animated. This is a workaround for setting engine pitch whilst also using doppler.
The code takes the X scale of the audiosource, applies doppler to it, then sets the pitch of the sound to it. Never animate the pitch directly (except for interior only sounds).
If you wish to blend different engine sounds, it's possible to do it in this animation.
It's using motion time, so frame 0 = 0 revs, last frame = whatever revs SaccGroundVehicle's 'Rev Limiter' variable is set to.

Tanks:
Tanks use the SaccGroundVehicle script (same as cars) I'll put the difference in set up here
When TankMode is enabled DriveWheels become the wheels on the left caterpiillar track, and SteerWheels become the wheels on the right track.
TANKS SHOULD HAVE THEIR SACCWHEEL SCRIPTS SYNCHRONIZATION METHOD SET TO 'NONE' OTHERWISE TOO MUCH NETWORK DATA WILL BE SENT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF WHEELS
Tank wheels ClutchStrength variable is set much lower than cars
The DFUNC_Bomb script(object name DFUNC_Cannon) has a variable called 'FireSyncDelegate', which is set to the turret script(EXT_Turret), which makes the turret itself actually run the code to fire the cannon.
This is done so that the cannon can snap to the correct angle and fire in one go, so that non-owner clients will see the turret shoot in the correct direction.
Rotation of wheels is a bit hacky on tanks. They all rotate independantly in the code, but in order for it not to look weird, they all copy a 'source' wheel's rotation. (WheelVisual_RotationSource)
Caterpillar tracks are controlled by SGV_Effects.
	The TracksRenderer reference should be the object with the track materials on it.
	the TrackMaterialSlots[] array contains integers, each of which is the material index on the TracksRenderer for the corresponding track.
	Put one wheel from each track into the TrackSourceWheels[] array, use the same wheel that you are using for source wheels for rotation on each wheel. (WheelVisual_RotationSource)
	The TrackSpeedMulti[] array has one entry for the movement speed of each track (texture UV scrolling)
	Each of the above arrays should be of the same length, or the script may crash
	There is also a 'cog' system, for rotating objects within the tracks that are not SaccWheels.
		Because each track can contain multiple cogs, I had to hard code arrays for each one. Cogs for up to 4 tracks are supported.
		CogWheelsTrack0[] and CogWheelsTrack0_rotSpeeds[] correspond to the source track definied by the first entry (element 0) of the TrackSourceWheels array.
		The transforms in CogWheelsTrack0[] will rotate with that source wheel, each ones rotation speed is multiplied by the corresponding entries in the CogWheelsTrack0_rotSpeeds[] array. (Smaller cogs need to rotate faster)

Hand Held Weapons:
It's possible to create hand held weapons with a function dial, but it's not really a good idea because if not seated, using the stick will move / turn your character.
	The prefab 'SaccRifle' is an experimental example, it uses DFUNCs only in the up and down directions of the right control stick, because those inputs do not effect your movement.
	Picking it up with your left hand does NOT change the function dial input to use the left controller, therefore picking up two makes both of them change at the same time.

Damage system:
Guns work by having one particle system of visible bullets, and one particle system of invisible bullets that actually do damage which is only enabled for the firer. The visible one is known as Gunparticle_other, and the pilot's damage one is known as GunParticle_pilot. Make sure if you change one, you change the other!
The 'GunParticle_pilot' is what does damage to planes. It is set to not collide with layer (OnBoardVehicleLayer(31)). The plane is set to OnBoardVehicleLayer you enter, so that you can't shoot your own plane, and reverted back to previous when you leave.
To make a gun do a different amount of damage, create a child empty game object under the 'GunParticle_pilot' particle system, and name it:
'd:20' to make it do 20 damage per particle. The default is 10 if you don't add this. Replace 20 with any number. Negative numbers work for healing.
The Wasp-WX3's guns and and SH-2's laser are examples that use this system to do more damage.
Particles can also be used to resupply, refuel, rearm or repair vehicles. If you instead name the child object to any of these words:
'resupply' - everything
'refuel' - fuel only
'rearm' - increase weapon ammo only
'repair' - increase health only
You can use more than one child to do more than one thing, and you can also use it in combination with a negative d: number for extra healing.
Projectile weapons have damage values that can be set on the respective scripts. They are found as children of the weapon DFUNC.
There is also a weapon type system that is unused in the base package, but developers can use to determine what weapon was used for kills. This system is in use in my 'Test Pilots' world.
For particle systems, a child object with a name like 't:3' is used. Projectile weapon scripts have their own variable for it called event_WeaponType. SaccEntity.cs has variable LastHitWeaponType where you can read what it was last hit by.

Armor System:
The armor system has also been rewritten as of 1.8.0. Since damage values are arbitrary now, damage can be arbitrarily reduce by armor.
All vehicles have an 'Armor Strength' variable on the SaccEntity script (set to 1 on all prefab vehicles, which does nothing (divides)) This value is used to multiply damage from all hits unless overrieden by the collider armor system.
Give any collider on a vehicle a child and name it like 'a:2' and this number will be used instead of the base armor value.
This system can be seen on the SaccTank prefab, where the front colliders have 'a:3', the side colliders have 'a:2' and the rear colliders have 'a:0.45' making it stronger on the front and weaker at the rear.
SaccEntity also has a NoDamageBelow value which is intended to prevent the vehicle from taking any damage at all from weak hits, the SaccTank has this value set to 100, making it invulnerable to any damage event that does less than 100 in one hit, making it impervious to small arms.

Crash Damage System:
Previously the only crash damage was done by G-forces, but this system has a problem in that if done per fixedUpdate the impulse will be calculated differently based on differences in update rate (FixedUpdate is set to match HMD refresh rate in VRChat)
This means that previously, higher refresh rate users would take more damage from crashing.
In order to solve this, I now Smooth G-force calculation over 0.1~ seconds instead of per-frame.
However, this makes all collisions cause much less damage, as a single impulse is spread out over multiple frames.
In order to fix that problem, there is a new crash damage system based on callbacks from the physics engine.
Vehicles now have 2 new variables, Crash_Damage_Speed and Crash_Death_Speed.
Crash_Damage_Speed is the speed at which vehicle will begin to take damage when crashing
	Crash_Death_Speed is the speed at which vehicle will die instantly when crashing
	Damage is interpolated linearly between these values

Radio Setup:
Place a RadioBase prefab into your world, and for each vehicle that you want to have a radio on add a new child object of the SaccEntity and give it a SAV_Radio script. In the SaccEntity script, add the new object to the Extension Udon behaviours array.
Nothing in the SAV_Radio script needs to be configured. Leave the Radio Seats array empty to make it effect all seats on the vehicle, if you put in any seats, only those seats will be able to use the radio.
The SAV_Radio script can also be used as a DFUNC, when used as a DFUNC, the radio channel can be changed by pulling the trigger and twisting(rolling) your hand, text object must be set up to display current channel. See the Function Dials section for how to set up DFUNCs.
As of version 1.8.1 there is an optional additional Listen Only channel in the SAV_Radio script, this channel can be changed by clicking and yawing the hand.
Do not include SAAV_Radio in Extension Udon behaviours array at the same time as a Dial_Functions array.
There is also a DFUNC_RadioPTT (Push to talk) script, set this up to only be heard on the radio while it's activated.

Custom Layers:
Vehicle colliders must be set to Walkthrough layer in order to be targeted by AAMs (By default anyway, configurable in SaccEntity(OutsideVehiclelayer), but all vehicles should have the same value.). (Raycast looks for this layer)
Various functions require custom layers to be set up in order to work(Air-to-air-missiles, Air-to-ground custom targets, resupply zones, Arresting cables, and catapults)
To rename the layers for SaccFlight, there is a menu option under SaccFlight->RenameLayers, clicking it will instantly change the layer names.
References to the layers will be retained by prefabs and will work, but they will appear blank until named in Unity. Layers are as follows
23:Hook Cable
24:Catapult
25:AAMTargets
26:AGMTargets
27:Resupply
28:Racing
31:OnboardVehicleLayer
The trigger objects that you may need to change the layer of are in the prefabs listed below. The plane's AAMTarget is a child of SaccAirVehicle(If it's not, it will not be treated like a vehicle(untargetable on ground etc).
The AAMTarget object on a plane MUST be a first child of the SaccAirVehicle object, or the code to play the radar lock warning tone will fail.

This package also contains a few prefabs that can be used with the vehicles. Explanations follow.

AAMDummyTarget
Target object that can be placed on anything that you want air-to-air missiles to be able to lock on to.

AGMLockTarget
object that if detected when attempting to lock target close to it with the AGM targeting system, will cause the targeted spot to snap to this location.
The trigger must be on the correct layer, the one selected in the DFUNC_AGM.

Arresting Cable
A prefab containing a cable mesh and a trigger designed to be placed on short runways or aircraft carriers to enable short landings.
The trigger must be on the correct layer, the one selected in the DFUNC_Hook.

Catapult
A prefab containing a catapult mesh and a trigger to enable the plane to launch quickly with no runway
The trigger must be on the correct layer, the one selected in the DFUNC_Catapult.
Catapult launches are controlled by an animation. The point in the animation where the trigger is disabled is the point at which the plane is released.
Catapults can be forced to launch vehicles at an exact speed by adding "speed=100" to the object with the animator on script on it. (m/s)

ResupplyZone
A prefab containing a square outline mesh with a trigger beneath it, used to reload, repair and refuel planes. Remove the mesh and just use the trigger if you want.
The trigger must be on the correct layer, the one selected in the ResupplyTrigger.
There are 4 kinda of resupply. The default is to resupply all. To use other resupply modes, create a child gameobject of the trigger object and name it one of these 3 names: xSUPPLY_FUEL, xSUPPLY_AMMO, xSUPPLY_REPAIR

Target
A basic example target object with configurable health that respawns, replace with your own mesh to create destroyable buildings, etc.
You can set it to never respawn by setting respawn delay to 0. You can use a script to respawn it manually if you desire, just called the RespawnTarget event to do so. The script on the vehicle respawn button can do this (SaccEntitySendEvent)
If you want a moving target, always move it in Update() rather than fixedUpdate(). If moving a target with an animator, do not set the animator to Animate Physics. This is because missiles are designed to track in Update() because the syncscript moves vehicles in Update().

Killsboard
The board that tells you who has the biggest kill streak and number of vehicles destroyed, requires setup, see above

RaceToggleButton
A basic menu for enabling and switching races

RadioBase
Contains the scipt for the radio system and a radio zone (stand inside to talk), vehicles require a SAV_Radio extension behaviour set up in their SaccEntity to work with the radio. See the Radio Setup section

SaccAirShowCam
A camera system for desktop use only, can lock on to vehicles and zoom in

SaccFlight
Avatar flight script container

SaccFlightAccessories
Depracated. A bunch of stuff together, contains the iconic cuboid

SaccFlightMenu
Menu for the vehicle options

SaccViewScreen
View screen where you can watch vehicles/camera points

SaccWalkieTalkie
Moveable RadioZone

VehicleEnterer
A small menu that allows you to enter anyones vehicle

WindControl
A pickup with sliders on it that allow you to control the strength and direction of the wind. Click while holding to apply wind.

I Suggest backing up your project before updating.
Major Changes in 1.11
A lot of variable names have changed so you will have to re-input values on most scripts. This was done because I removed RespawnTrigger.
Exploding planes. SF-1 now has HP and takes damage from crashing and getting shot.
I have also shuffled around the hierarchy of the SF-1 to support exploding more easily.
Replaced the respawntrigger with station triggers, and
Replaced the different LeaveButtons with just one
Custom Pitching Moment Setting
Might run a bit faster
